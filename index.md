_**[Sentiment Analysis of Firm 10k's to Analyze Stock Return Correlation](report/report.md)**_

The goal of this project was to analyze the tone or "sentiment" of S&P500 firms' 10k's to see if the sentiment has any correlation to stock returns. To do so, we used textual analysis strategies to create a "sentiment score" for different topics for each 10k. Then, we calcualted the returns for a couple of days after the release of their 10k and analyzed the correlation between those variables. Below you can see the plot I created mapping the correlations between the returns and each of the sentiment scores I created.

_**[Regression Practice](regression/regression.md)**_

In this assignment, I explored regressions in Python on the housing_train dataset, a dataset containing information on 1941 housing purchases from 2006 to 2008. Below, you will see the summary table with statistics from the six regressions I performed.

## Career Objectives

I am a natural and determined leader looking for opportunities to utilize leadership and communication skills and explore potential career paths in business. With my wide variety of skills, I am looking to explore different opportunities in Finance and Supply Chain Management to discover which path I want to pursue after graduation. This summer, I will be interning at Wayfair as an Operations Analyst, and I am excited to learn about what the Supply Chain Management field is like in practice.

## Hobbies

I am a huge sports fan, in pretty much every way. I am one of the biggest Boston sports fans you will meet, and I love playing sports like basketball to get exercise regularly. Additionally, I enjoy lifting for exercise too. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, as I love hiking in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. See below for a picture of me hiking in the Italian Dolomites this past summer.
